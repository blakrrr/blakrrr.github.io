        <p>Derse and Prospit are the moons in Homestuck. To be honest, they don’t affect much, both casting and actually story-wise. My personal way of casting is some random Tumblr post I read a while ago: Derse dreamers are warriors learning to become heroes, and Prospit dreamers are heroes learning to become warriors. I personally placed people by how I see their resolve. For me, there are some canonical shenanigans with doom players having two dream selves. I don’t really get it but I follow canon so whatever.</p>

    <h1>Noelle <br> Maid of Light (note: using the word light refers to the aspect, not the actual thing light.)</h1>
    
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>A Maid is a passive class, and is described as someone “creates [aspect] or one who creates through [aspect].” Both are, well, slightly vague, but can be expanded on. Maids tend to be relatively unaffected by their aspect personally; an Heir’s personality may almost directly line up with the base of their aspect, but Maids are more likely to follow and serve their aspect rather than inheriting it directly. I personally follow the argument that Maids lack their aspect and hunt it for both the betterment of themselves and others. This doesn’t make you like a loser or anything, but your aspect moreso portrays something you lack, something you depend on others for (more accurately, acquire over a period of time) rather than something that directly stands in line with you.<br> <br> 

 Light is a very interesting aspect, as it takes on a very non-literal form. Even aspects like Void can be physically defined, and while Light can be defined as — get this, light — its metaphorical meanings outweigh the physical. Light has (arguably) three representations. The simplest of this is knowledge. Light, being a more passive class, doesn’t have much physical powers, at least not in comparison to strategic ones. Knowledge is what it sounds like. Light players tend to have a different outlook on situations, or ways of gaining or understanding knowledge that is significantly different than others. Luck is another third, and is significantly more influential than knowledge. Light players have strong manipulations of luck, and sometimes can directly influence it by their choice. A common theme with Light players, however, is a strong downfall due their overuse of luck manipulation combined with the subjectiveness of it. Luck typically follows the user’s perceived strongest outcome, rather than the objective one. The final section of Light powers follows relevancy, attention, and confidence. Light players tend to have too much or too little of these, and this falls in line with the luck manipulation. I’m avoiding using canon examples, or at least by name, but the undeniable example of this is Vriska as a character. Her constant desire to “make things happen” makes her push herself into plot relevance, take charge when she shouldn’t, or do things that cause harm simply because they “needed to happen.” In summary, Light players follow a manipulation of knowledge, luck, and confidence due to their lacks or abundances of these.<br><br>  

Finally, the Maid of Light is a passive class who creates Light or creates through Light. This light may take the form of knowledge, confidence, attention, or luck. A Maid of Light is not a fighter, but that doesn’t disqualify them from taking initiative. They may be the one to turn the tide of battle, to gather info nobody could begin to find, to commune with sources unfathomable to others, to force outcomes one in a million, a Maid of Light is not to be underestimated. However, their powers are truly subjective and can only be used how they believe it can be used. Their general lack of Light makes them weak, and their development of it can only come from themselves. However, a Maid, once fully realizing their potential, is unmatched in their abilities to bring their aspect to others.<br> <br> 

Author’s Notes - I’m not calling Maids pathetic or anything, but their hardships would certainly outweigh the benefits. You’d have serious trouble remaining relevant, which outside of a narrative perspective is kinda horrifying. A general lack of self-confidence and benefits to others leave you isolated, depending on others to give you that confidence and purpose. However, over time, you would begin to truly find yourself and your purpose. It may take a crashout, a moment with someone previously unknown, or an eternity to yourself to truly understand your own worth, but it’s what’d bring you over the edge to make a positive mark. And once you reach that point, it’s only upward. I don’t know, that’s how I’d define your character arc at least. Maids are tricky. There’s not a lot in canon about them, aside from suffering to become insanely powerful. Again, not trying to turn you into a book character or anything but I kinda think that fits? Don’t take that the wrong way. Light is for the cocky, but justified. Those truly powerfully but deserving of the power, due to either their ability to get shit done or their intense resolve, which usually results in shit getting done anyways. I think those blend together really well. You’d kinda represent the sacrifice of living life without a purpose, until you can bring yourself to understand that living life with a purpose is invaluable if you can’t truly appreciate yourself as a person. You’d rather be the best person for the people that deserve it than some tool for losers who don’t.<br> <br>
